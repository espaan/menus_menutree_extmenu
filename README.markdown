This project will hold several menus made for the Zikula 1.3 menu blocks. 
Inside Zikula 1.3 Core there is the extmenu (a single level, multi language menublock) and menutree (multi-level multi language menublock).

Menutree was a seperate module for Zikula 1.2 and the location of templates, style sheets, etc has changed with the new version as part of the Core of Zikula 1.3

In the wiki pages there is a page on converting menus for menutree in Zikula 1.2 to Menutree in Zikula 1.3.
